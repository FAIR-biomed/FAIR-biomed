# Privacy

The extension records a small amount of information to personalize its behavior to each user. This data pertains to which plugins are active (see previous section on Options), how many times each plugin is used, and whether each plugin is rated or bookmarked. This information remains on each user's computer and can be adjusted through the Options page. This information is not shared with outside services.

The extension only processes query text that appears in its search box. The extension does not automatically scan entire documents.  

The extension does not record performed searches. Note, however, that the extension sends queries to external APIs. Some of these services may record activity (for example, to demonstrate their relevance to the science community). See the privacy policies of those services for details.

When installing the extension from the chrome web store, Google collects some user information. See their [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB) for details.
