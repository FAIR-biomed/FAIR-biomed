    <p>Biomedical data are distributed in open databases and knowledge bases. The FAIR-biomed browser extension allows
        you to access snippets of this data from any web page.</p>

    <p>Select some text in your browser window. With the mouse, open a context menu and
        select the extension, <code>right-click > FAIR-biomed search</code>. Alternatively, press
        <code>Ctr+Shift+Z</code> on the keyboard. A popup window will show a collection of data resources that may have
        additional information pertaining to the query.</p>

    <p>Additional information can be found on the <a href="https://fair-biomed.github.io">FAIR-biomed website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Plugin library</h2>
    <div id="fair-library"></div>

    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <p>The order in which plugins appear in popups is determined by whether each plugin can respond to the query and
        by the number of times each plugin was used in the past.</p>
    <div class="fair-reset-button" id="fair-reset-button">Reset plugin usage</div>

    <p>The extension offers a library of plugins to choose from, but it can be configured to automatically
    load results using the last-used component.</p>
