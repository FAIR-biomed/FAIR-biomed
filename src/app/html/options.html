    <p>Biomedical data are distributed in open databases and knowledge bases. The FAIR-biomed browser extension allows
        you to access snippets of this data from any web page.</p>

    <p>Select some text in your browser window. With the mouse, open a context menu and
        select the extension, <code>right-click > FAIR-biomed search</code>. Alternatively, press
        <code>Ctr+Shift+Z</code> on the keyboard. A popup window will show a collection of data resources that may have
        additional information pertaining to the query.</p>

    <p>Additional information can be found on the <a href="https://fair-biomed.github.io">FAIR-biomed website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Plugin library</h2>
    <div id="fair-library"></div>

    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <p>The order in which plugins appear in popups is determined by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>whether a plugin can respond to a query, and</li>
        <li>the number of times a plugin was used in the past.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Information about past usage is stored in the browser local storage.</p>
    <div class="fair-reset-button" id="fair-reset-button">Reset plugin usage</div>

    <p class="fair-padtop">By default, the extension popup displays a list of plugins and waits for a selection before
        fetching information from remote databases. Alternative, it can automatically fetch data from the last-used component.</p>
    <div id="fair-auto-last"></div>
