    <b>HOCOMOCO v11</b></a> motif collection provides transcription factor (TF) binding models for human and mouse TFs.
    In addition to basic mononucleotide position weight matrices (PWMs), HOCOMOCO provides dinucleotide position weight matrices based on ChIP-Seq data.
    All the models were produced by the ChIPMunk motif discovery tool. Model quality ratings are results of a comprehensive cross-validation benchmark.
    ChIP-Seq data for motif discovery was extracted from GTRD database.
