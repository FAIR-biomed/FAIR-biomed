<p>The GWAS Catalog provides a consistent, searchable, visualisable and freely available database of published SNP-trait associations, which can be easily integrated with other resources, and is accessed by scientists, clinicians and other users worldwide. Within the Catalog, all eligible GWA studies are identified by literature search and assessed by our curators, who then extract the reported trait, significant SNP-trait associations, and sample metadata.</p>
