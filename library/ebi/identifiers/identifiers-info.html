<p>Identifiers.org is an established resolving system that enables the referencing of data for the scientific community, with a current focus on the Life Sciences domain. It handles persistent identifiers in the form of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and CURIEs (Compact URIs). This allows the referencing of data in both a location-independent and resource-dependent manner. The provision of resolvable identifiers (URLs, or Uniform Resource Locators) fits well with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> vision, and the <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</a> initiative.</p>
