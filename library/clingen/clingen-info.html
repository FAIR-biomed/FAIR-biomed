<p>ClinGen is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded resource dedicated to building an authoritative central resource that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research.</p>

<p>The ClinGen Allele Registry provides unique variant identifiers both programmatically (via APIs) and via this search interface. If a variant is not present in the Registry, authorized users may register the variant and get an identifier within seconds. The variants are automatically mapped across known reference sequences and to identifiers from major variant databases.</p>
