<p>On June 22, 2000, UCSC and the other members of the International Human Genome Project consortium completed the first working draft of the human genome assembly, forever ensuring free public access to the genome and the information it contains. A few weeks later, on July 7, 2000, the newly assembled genome was released on the web at http://genome.ucsc.edu, along with the initial prototype of a graphical viewing tool, the UCSC Genome Browser. In the ensuing years, the website has grown to include a broad collection of vertebrate and model organism assemblies and annotations, along with a large suite of tools for viewing, analyzing and downloading data.</p>
